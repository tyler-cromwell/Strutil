# What is Strutil?

  Strutil is a simple string library that I've been using to supplement the string functions in the [C Standard Library][C Standard Library].

# Functions
  - `contains`: Tests if a sequence is contained in a string.
  - `endsWith`: Tests if a string ends with a given token.
  - `startsWith`: Tests if a string starts with a given token.
  - `indexOf`: Gets the FIRST index of a character within a string.
  - `indexesOf`: Gets ALL indexes of a character withing a string
  - `removeThese`: Removes all given characters from a string.
  - `replaceAll`: Replaces each occurence of a character with a new character in a string.
  - `split`: Splits a string at each occurence of a token. Returns an array of Strings.
  - `substring`: Gets a substring within a given range.
  - `trim`: Trims the leading and trailing spaces in a string.
